## Project Communication and Collaboration

**Riot.im:** various chat rooms under the "cylc" organisation.
- day-to-day chat (group and ad hoc one-to-one Rooms) for figuring stuff out,
  too dynamic and too much detail for GitHub Issues
- group video conference and ad hoc video chat.

**Trello:** project board(s) under "The Cylc Workflow Engine" Team.
- for keeping track of topics, and recording related conclusions and decisions
  reached on Riot. Trello card decks should eventually resolve to multiple
  GitHub Issues

**GitHub Issues**: [cylc](https://github.com/cylc)
- describe implementation of single well-defined topics that will eventually
  result in a single PR (some may still result in multiple PRs, but full-blown
  discussion can now go to Riot, and the big overarching Issues that we used to
  have can be better handled on Trello)

**Cylc Admin:** (THIS SITE) overarching summary documents to explain our
strategy to others, and to track of the full project (Gantt chart and list of
major tasks as one-liners).

**Google Groups Cylc Forum:** 
- release announcements, plus usage questions, feature requests, and bug
  reports from remote users (outside of the main sites).
- **DEPRECATED** pending a move to **Cylc Discourse Forum** (hope to bring
  main-site users in here too).
