# Work on Platforms

The description of work to be done collected here rather than based on more
transitory tickets.

Based on notes originally created by @OSanders.

## Approach:
Most of the work can be done in relatively small PRs creating new functions
each of which can be unit tested, and which will not break master.

Toward the end of the work the new configurations will need to be wired into
Cylc - this is likely to be a slightly more complex piece of work.

## â€‹Blocking PRs:

(these things block the "wiring" portion of the work):
* Python Endpoints
* ZMQ Curve Authentication
* Incremental Data Store Updates

## The tasks:

### Job Platform Spec

Add job platforms section to `cylc/flow/cfgspec/global_config.rc`.
* Include the content currently included in the `[hosts][many]` section.
* Do not include the `[hosts][localhost]`

Add platform setting to the task section of `cylc/flow/cfgspec/suite.rc`.

Move Configs from `suite.rc[runtime][TASK][job/remote]` to
`flow.rc[platforms][__MANY__]`. [The diff for PR #3348](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3348/files/cb83a8ac04ac567488ae97061ee0f934ffc46bbd..ae70eafc03e045ce6255a8bb5910ca208991fb65) should provide further details.


### Forward Lookup
PREREQS: "job platform spec"

How Cylc 8 will pick a job platform using `[runtime][TASK]platform=MyPlatform`

Write a function which takes the "platform" field from the task config
forward(platform_name_or_function) -> job platform dict

This will probably end up in `cfgspec/global_config.py` in the same way that
`def get_host_item()` currently is.

Note the platform_function (i.e. rose host-select) functionality. This may not
be fully testable within the scope of this ticket, since in some cases it may
not be evaluated until job submission time.

This function will need unit testing but will not be wired into cylc as part of
this ticket.

This code can be written and tested without breaking master since it will not
yet be used outside its own tests.

### Reverse Lookup
PREREQS: "job platform spec"

How Cylc 8 will pick a job platform using a Cylc 7 compatible `suite.rc`

Write a function which returns a job platform from available information

This will probably end up in `cfgspec/global_config.py` in the same way that
`def get_host_item()` currently is.

For context this information could come from the task configuration...
...or the database, where it comes from doesn't matter right now.

reverse(host, batch_sys, user=None) -> platform_name

This should return the platform name if there is exactly one possible
...or raise an error otherwise.

This function will need unit testing but will not be wired into cylc as part of
this ticket.

This code can be written and tested without breaking master since it will not
yet be used outside its own tests.

### Config Upgrader

PREREQS: "reverse lookup"

Write a test battery to show how the old settings should be converted
Write a function which actually does that (but for the moment doesn't
remove the old configurations).

This function will need unit testing but will not be wired into cylc as part of
this ticket.

This code can be written and tested without breaking master since it will not
yet be used outside its own tests.

### DB Upgrader

PREREQS: "reverse lookup"

Much the same as the previous but for the database.

The database stores the host and batch_system, we would need to upgrade
This could be done towards the end, you might need to put off upgrading
the DB but instead upgrade the information coming out of the database.

This function will need unit testing but will not be wired into cylc as part of
this ticket.

This code can be written and tested without breaking master since it will not
yet be used outside its own tests.

### Wiring: Replacing the use of all settings under hosts.

PREREQS: "forward lookup"

Examine the code base for references to use of settings based on hosts and
replace all the references to hosts with platforms.

This work is complete when you can deprecate all the old configurations.
