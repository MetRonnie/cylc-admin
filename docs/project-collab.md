# Project Communication and Collaboration

**Element:** various chat rooms under the
  [cylc organisation](https://app.element.io/#/group/+cylc:matrix.org).
- day-to-day chat (group and ad hoc one-to-one Rooms) for figuring stuff out,
  too dynamic and too much detail for GitHub Issues
- group video conference and ad hoc video chat.

**Trello:** project board(s) under
  ["The Cylc Workflow Engine" Team](https://trello.com/cylcworkflow).
- for keeping track of topics, and recording related conclusions and decisions
  reached on Element.
- Trello card decks should eventually resolve to multiple GitHub Issues
- Deck names should be pretty broad, with specific cards for sub-topics.

**GitHub Issues**: [cylc](https://github.com/cylc)
- describe implementation of single well-defined topics that eventually result
  in single (or few) Pull Requests
- (detail should be discussed on Element, and big overarching Issues can be
  tracked on Trello)

**Cylc Admin:** (THIS SITE)
- summary documents to explain our strategy to others
- and to track the project globally (Gantt chart etc.)

**Discourse:** [Cylc Forum](https://cylc.discourse.group/)
- release announcements, plus usage questions, feature requests, and bug
  reports from remote users (outside of the main sites).
