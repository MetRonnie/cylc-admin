# User Research Interaction Summaries

## Listing of all interactions

As a concise way to get a rundown of all interactions quickly, **briefly note
all UR interactions in the below table**. Detail should then be added directly
(if brief), or linked into (if lengthy), from separate files under individual
sections in the 'Interaction Summaries' section below (see example).

| # | Metomi member(s) (initials) | User(s) (if applicable) \* | Datetime (to the day at least) | Section described (descriptive tag) |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | --- |
| *0* | *\<EXAMPLE:\> SB*   | *\<EXAMPLE:\> BF* | *\<EXAMPLE:\> 2019-06-04T14:45* | *\<EXAMPLE:\> SB Example  |
| 1 | TP, OS | "a group of (mostly power) users" | 2019-06-06 | Suites Guild GUI Discussion 1 |
| 2 | OS| n/a (auto-generated report) | ????-??-?? | gcylc usage at MO |

\* (for individuals use initials**in case some users would not like their opinions accessible in such an
open document. However, please ensure you will remember, else make a written
note about, which user this is, as initials may clash.


## Summaries of all interactions

See the example below, though note the individual record format does not have
to be as per the example and can be anything that seems appropriate.

The level of detail depends on the context, but please try to record a good
amount of information to include details even if they may not seem especially
important (they could later emerge as useful).
