## Cylc 8 MVP
- [Development timeline from the mid-Feb
  workshop](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-admin/feb2020-workshop-report#tentative-development-timeline)
- We really need to:
  - get delta tree in? [AlMOST]
  - get Spawn-on-demand in [ALMOST]
  - get platforms in [ALMOST]
  - get performant tree view done [BK says pretty easy?]
  - THEN focus entirely on the ESSENTIALS for 8.0
