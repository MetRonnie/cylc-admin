# Cylc Project Admin

A repository of planning documents etc. for the Cylc Workflow Engine.

For the Cylc team to collaborate on documents that either do not belong with
the Cylc source code (such as meeting agendas) or which inhabit a grey zone
between initial planning/discussion and inclusion in the official project
documentation.
